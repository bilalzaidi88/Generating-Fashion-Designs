# Generating-Fashion-Designs

Generate fashion designs using Tensorflow! Retail is an incredibly lucrative field to enter because so much of retail currently relies on physical assets (stores, clothing, equipment) and a lot of this can now be automated using machine learning technology. We can use generative models to generate shoes, shirts, dresses, unique mugs, basically anything that someone would want to buy. We just need to find a relevant dataset. Generative modeling is incredibly powerful technology that will change how we interact with the internet (see DeepFakes). In this homework, you'll generate novel fashion designs.
